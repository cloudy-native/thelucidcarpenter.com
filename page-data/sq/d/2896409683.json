Each board measures 12 in x 16 in x 3/4 in and has four non-slip silicone feet.\n\nYours will be similar to one of the above. We start with unfinished slabs each so one is unique. \n\nBoards are finished with Odie&#39;s Oil, which is completely food safe. \n\nWill not hold up to significant chopping and definitely no hot dishes.","title":"One beautiful black walnut and epoxy charcuterie board"}},{"node":{"id":"gsetsy_listing_905359193","description":"There are lots of &quot;river tables&quot; to choose from on Etsy. I hope you like mine. They are made with ❤️.\n\nIf you like the look, I will make you a table like this one. If you want something different I&#39;ll be thrilled to make that too!\n\nThe delivery timeline reflects the fact tables are built from scratch just for you. I am happy to bring you along for the ride as I build your table with as much detail as you&#39;d like.\n\nYou can select the wood: Walnut, Olive, Maple, and some more unusual species. Rarer and highly figured slabs are harder to source and will affect the price. I&#39;ll send you links to my trusted wood suppliers so you can browse for a slab that says &quot;you.&quot;\n\nYou can choose the color of the epoxy resin river. Black is a safe bet for all woods. Blues and greens can work well with lighter slabs like Maple. Mix and match. In addition to the tint you can mix mica powder of different shades for a unique pearlescent look.\n\nSelect 19 inch legs for coffee tables and 30 inch for tables you can sit at. Other sizes are available too.","title":"Wood and epoxy river tables"}},{"node":{"id":"gsetsy_listing_905353059","description":"This one-of-a-kind long narrow coffee is live-edge walnut with slightly translucent black epoxy on black hairpin legs.
