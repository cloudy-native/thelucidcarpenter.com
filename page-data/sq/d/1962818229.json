Welcome to my store.\r\n\r\nEvery step of crafting a river table is a pleasure and an opportunity to get to know and appreciate wood in new ways. Each slab is as unique as the tree it came from and brings its own quirks and idiosyncrasies to the table. (Sorry.) I only use reclaimed or sustainably grown wood from trusted suppliers.\r\n\r\nI usually use select slabs of walnut and black epoxy. If I find nicely figured wood of different species I use that too. And the epoxy doesn&#39;t always have to be black.\r\n\r\nI also do computers.","url":"https://www.etsy.com/shop/TheLucidChisel/about"}]}}}
